#### Hey Everyone!

Thanks for a great first class. I"m looking forward to working with you all over the next 6 weeks and seeing your projects come to life.

These notes will be sent out at the end of every class and will include a recap of what we covered in lecture, as well as some extra reading material (optional) or resources for learning more on the day's topic. I'll also include answers to anything that crops up during class.

If you have any questions or get stuck on something during the week please feel free to drop me a message on Slack.

Today we looked at what will be covered in the curriculum:

#### Week One - Three

Project #1 - Resumes

- HTML: Building Blocks
- CSS: Styling
- Responsive Design

#### Week Four - Five

Project #2 - Web App

- Javascript: Making Web Apps dynamic

#### Week Six

Project #2 contd...

- jQuery: A library with helpful Javascript functions

And we looked at some Web Dev terms:

#### Front-End

- The translation of design to code.
- Front end languages live in the browser (HTML, CSS, Javascript)

#### Back-End

- Handles the logic and data of the app
- Deals with requests from the front-end

#### Database

- Where data is stored
- Like an excel spreadsheet but with more searching power

Remember to ask lots of questions and have fun!

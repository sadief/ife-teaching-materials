# Intro to Front End

***Set up the Live Stream***

### Front End Fundamentals
 - First slide Intro


### Welcome to Lighthouse Labs
 - Lighthouse is a Web and IOS Development school
 - In addition to this we also run
    - Intro to Web Development - PT
    - Web Development Bootcamp
    - IOS Development Bootcamp
    - Blockchain for Developers

  #### Housekeeping
    - Bathrooms
    - Slack for communication
    - If you can't make it, Slack
    - Can't get back into building


### Meet Your Instructors
- Or in your case, instructor!
- I'm Sadie, I'm from Banff originally
- 7 years in UK, Learning & Development for a Restaurant Group
- Moved back, took LHL Bootcamp
- Now I'm a Software Developer at a company called Biba Ventures
- We make AR games to get kids active on playgrounds
- I love coding, I'm lucky enough to do it as my job but I still like to do it for fun!
- It's like solving puzzles all day long and sometimes it's frustrating
- But when something clicks it's the best feeling


### Icebreakers
- Sorry. My notes literally say
- Apologize for making them do ice breakers, and then make them do ice breaker activities.


### Rules
- Select a number between 1-10


### Questions
- Discuss these with a group of 2-3


### Your Turn
- Now it's your turn
- Tell us your name (as you would prefer to be addressed)
- What are you up to (work/school?)
- What brought you here and/ or what are you hoping to get out of this course
- Your Icebreaker question


### We love feedback
- The way we make this course better is from your feedback
- No feedback is too big, too small, too nice, or too critical
- Please share any feedback you have with myself and also on Compass as you go through
- At the end of every activity there is a place for feedback


### Class Format
- Some days the format might vary a little bit
- For the most part, we'll have an hour lecture, then two hours to work on Compass
- The lecture will be a mix of slides and live coding (just not today)
- The work part I am here for the entirety of and you can call me over whenever you need help
- Every class will be taking what we've learned and adding it to our projects bit by bit
- The lectures are recorded and I will send out class notes at the end of every class


### Projects
- Two project - HTML, and Javascript
- Walk through of each project
- Show links ***(bookmarked)***
- [Echo site](http://echo.getforge.io/) - this is a resume for my cat
- [Weather](http://jquery-weather.surge.sh/)
- [Horoscope](http://horoscope.surge.sh/)
- [Drinks Recipe](http://drink-recipe-finder.surge.sh/)


### Code
- What is code?
- Writing instructions for computers to follow
- You do not have to be good at Math or Science!
- I am not from a math or science background at all!
- I love problem solving and logic puzzles and figuring things out
- Also there's no such thing as being 'naturally' good at coding.
- Persistence is key


### Quote
- Coding is an art!
- There is way more than one way to solve a problem
- Don't compare yourselves to others!


### Languages
- Brief explanation of each Language
  - Week One - HTML
    - the building blocks or foundation to any website
  - Week Two and Three - CSS
    - Where the styling comes in
  - Week Four to Six - Javascript and jQuery
    - Javascript is what makes our webpages dynamic and adds functionality
    - jQuery is a JS library
    - A Library is a set of useful functions already created for us


### Elements of a Web App
- Difference between a web app (Facebook) and web page (LighthouseLabs)
- 3 Main components of a Web App
  - Front-End
  - Back-End
  - Database
  - Draw the three part diagram (client, server, cylinder db)


### Front End
- A front end developer translates design into code - they use well designed layouts from designers
- They stand between the designer and the back end developer take the data from the back end developer
- Front end languages live in the browser (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
- Each play a separate role in building the front end of a web application. (How it’s structured, how it looks and how it functions).
- This class is all about front end


### Back End
- A backend developer is responsible for handling the requests from the front end
- The logic of a web app lives in the server


### Database
- A Database is like an excel spreadsheet but with more searching power
- There are different types of databased but the most common is SQL
- Expand on diagram with arrows to show how SQL queries work
- What is a stack? Collection of software/languages


### What does a developer do?
- Does anyone work with a developer? What are they like?
- Lots of different types (full, front, back, db)
- Developers translate business requirements or design mock ups into code
- They don't work on their own in the basement! They work in collaborative teams


### Developers 101
- Developers are opinionated
  - Explain that developers all have their preferred tools, and languages.
  - Take them with a grain of salt, and learn to form your own opinions about things.

- Developers are lazy
  - Briefly explain DRY, and that we don’t want to write more code than we have to.
  - This is why libraries and frameworks are popular:
      - they take away some of the common problems, and allow us to focus on building our sites and web apps quickly and efficiently.

- Developers like coffee.
  - Obvs.


### Uh what does that mean?
- Open source is code that is public and open to the public to modify for free
  - Atom
  - Nodejs
  - React
- Closed source is not public
  - Google search algorithm
- Stack is a collection of software/languages
- Bug is something that causes an error in your code. These will have you banging your head against a wall for hours and then you cry when you realize it's a missing semicolon.
- Git is used to track versions of code as projects develop and get larger.


### Tips for this class
- There will be times when you get stuck, frustrated, or feel overwhelmed
- This is totally ok and completely normal
- Don't stress about memorizing anything. We like to google. I will probably Google in class.
- Have fun! It's awesome when something clicks - celebrate that!
- Development doesn't have to be a career, it can also be a really fun hobby. Makes a great career too though. There's always SO much to learn.
- The Lighthouse way - doing things the hard way first "firehose"


### Tools
- Does anyone use Slack at work? Slack is a messaging app and super useful
- Please update your photo (it's a huge help)

- Atom is where we will be writing code ***demo***

- Compass is where you will do your work. ***demo***
  - We wont use the queue but they use it in bootcamp

- If you are going to be late or miss class you can contact me on Slack. Please don't be late.
- You can also message me for help


### Wireframing
- Wireframing is like sketching out the plans for our web app before we start to write code
  - You wouldn't start building a house without a building plan would you?
- Show wireframes from work
- ***Demo*** of mockflow
- You can also use paper and pen if you prefer!

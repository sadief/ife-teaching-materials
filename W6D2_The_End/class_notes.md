### The End!

Congratulations! You've finished the course now! You've all worked so hard over the past 6 weeks and I hope you are very proud of what you've accomplished. You've learned _loads_!

Here are some resources to keep coding with:

#### Community

There is a Vancovuer Developers Slack channel which is a great forum to ask for help on projects, checkout freelance opportunities, or get together and code with others!

[Vancouver Developers](https://yvrdev.herokuapp.com/)

And if you join the channel #lhl-coffee-code you can come hang out with us on Wednesdays and work on coding projects!

If you are interested in ethics in tech, we also have an ethics in tech meetup group - we'll probably have a group for this in Vancouver Developers at some point but if you're interested, feel free to drop me an email (sadiefreeman@gmail.com) and I can put you in touch.

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) Also has a ton of meetups for tech - these can be a great way to meet developers and get advice on projects.

#### HTML & CSS

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) Basically the CSS bible

- [Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag) All things front-end Youtube videos

- [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) Tutorial for learning CSS Grid which is sort of like the next level up from Flexbox

- [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/) Like Flexbox Froggy but for CSS Grid!

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) A CSS framework

#### Javascript & jQuery

- [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) Tutorial for Javascript by Wes Bos who has some great material

- [CodeWars](/www.codewars.com) Great for practising Javascript problems

- [FunFunFunctions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) Javascript Youtube videos

### General Courses

- [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) Free courses! Their Web Development curriculum is particularly useful for HTML, CSS, and Javascript

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) Paid courses but they have sales often

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) they have a great curriculum you can work through

- [Lighthouse's Free Courses](http://lighthouse-labs.thinkific.com/)

Keep coding, keep finding projects to work on that you enjoy, and keep learning!

### Languages

We talked about other languages - there are TONS and lots of different reasons to use each one. My suggestion it to really dive into Javascript before starting a new language, but here's a great article on some other languages:

[Beginner Programming Languages](https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/beginner-programming-language-job-salary-community-7s26wmbm6)

### Raspberry Pi / Robotics

We don't cover this in the course but I know some of you were interested so here's some links!

- [Beginner's Guide to Raspberry Pi](https://gizmodo.com/the-beginners-guide-to-the-raspberry-pi-1782608097)
- [Make your own robot car](https://www.elegoo.com/) Or Penguin bot, etc.. This uses Arduino (which uses C++ for the code, but you don't need to know any C++ to make it). Honestly one of the funnest things I'v emad ein my adult life.

### The End

Enjoy your coding journey! If you are interested in any other courses at Lighthouse, you can get in touch by emailing hello@lighthouselabs.ca

If there's any other resources that we talked about that aren't on this list, feel free to remind me!

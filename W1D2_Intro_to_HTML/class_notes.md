Hey everyone! Thanks for a great class tonight - looking forward to seeing what you create over the next 6 weeks! Here is today's lecture along with some notes.
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

# W1D1

Today we learned about HTML and what it does. Html has little to do with how our webpage actually looks, but it adds **context** to our **content**.

# Atom

Atom is a text editor for our code! Here's some handy tips for using Atom:

- If there is a blue dot on your file tab then it means it hasn't been saved with your latest changes
- Some handy keyboard shortcuts:
  - Command + C - Copy
  - Command + V - Paste
  - Command + S - Save
  - Command + D - Select everything with the same text that I have selected
- Some useful packages to install to help make your life easier
  - atom-beautify _auto indents your code for you_
  - autoclose-html _closes your html tags automatically_
  - open-html-in-browser _opens up your html file in your browser_ OR you can use Hilary's awesome tip and click the bottom left corner file name and it will copy the address for you which you can then paste in your url bar in the browser

# Web Page vs Web App

- A Web Page is purely informational and is static
- A Web App is interactive and dynamic

# HTML tags

```
  <p> I'm a paragraph! </p>

```

Most HTML tags have:

- An opening tags
- Some content
- A closing tag

# HTML Text Tags

These are a few of the common HTML tags that we use to wrap text in:

```
 <h1>, <h7>
 <p>
 <strong> Note below
 <em>
```

- When I was talking about strong and em in the lecture I _meant_ strong and <b> which is an unused tag now. Strong should be used to bold important text, and em should be used to place emphasis on a word

# Nested tags

We can also next HTML tags together:

```
<div>
  <h3>My Awesome Webpage</h3>
</div>

```

Here the div is the parent and h3 is the child.

# Semantic tags

Good HTML should tell a story and convey meaning. <div> tags are fairly generic, and if you have a tag that better explains what you are using it for - then you should use it over a div.

Some examples of semantic tags are:

<header>
<main>
<section>
<article>

# Boilerplate

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
   	 <title>My Awesome Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  	<!-- Content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>

```

- <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
- <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
- <head> element contains meta information about the document
- <title> element specifies a title for the document
- <body> element contains the visible page content

# Remember to always indent! (or make your text editor do it for you)

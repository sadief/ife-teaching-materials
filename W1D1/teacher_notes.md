### Meet Your Instructors
- Or in your case, instructor!
- I'm Sadie, I'm from Banff originally
- 7 years in UK, Learning & Development for a Restaurant Group
- Moved back, took LHL Bootcamp
- Now I'm a Software Developer at a company called Biba Ventures
- We make AR games to get kids active on playgrounds
- I love coding, I'm lucky enough to do it as my job but I still like to do it for fun!
- It's like solving puzzles all day long and sometimes it's frustrating
- But when something clicks it's the best feeling

### Icebreakers
- Sorry. My notes literally say
- Apologize for making them do ice breakers, and then make them do ice breaker activities.

### Rules
- Select a number between 1-10

### Questions
- Discuss these with a group of 2-3

### Your Turn
- Now it's your turn
- Tell us your name (as you would prefer to be addressed)
- What are you up to (work/school?)
- What brought you here and/ or what are you hoping to get out of this course
- Your Icebreaker question

### We love feedback
- The way we make this course better is from your feedback
- No feedback is too big, too small, too nice, or too critical
- Please share any feedback you have with myself and also on Compass as you go through
- At the end of every activity there is a place for feedback

### Class Format
- Some days the format might vary a little bit
- For the most part, we'll have an hour lecture, then two hours to work on Compass
- The lecture will be a mix of slides and live coding (just not today)
- The work part I am here for the entirety of and you can call me over whenever you need help
- Every class will be taking what we've learned and adding it to our projects bit by bit
- The lectures are recorded and I will send out class notes at the end of every class

### Projects
- Two project - HTML, and Javascript
- Walk through of each project

- [Weather](http://jquery-weather.surge.sh/)
- [Horoscope](http://horoscope.surge.sh/)
- [Drinks Recipe](http://drink-recipe-finder.surge.sh/)


### Code
- What is code?
- Writing instructions for computers to follow
- You do not have to be good at Math or Science!
- I am not from a math or science background at all!
- I love problem solving and logic puzzles and figuring things out
- Also there's no such thing as being 'naturally' good at coding.
- Persistence is key


### Quote
- Coding is an art!
- There is way more than one way to solve a problem
- Don't compare yourselves to others!

### Languages
- Brief explanation of each Language
  - Week One - HTML
    - the building blocks or foundation to any website
  - Week Two and Three - CSS
    - Where the styling comes in
  - Week Four to Six - Javascript and jQuery
    - Javascript is what makes our webpages dynamic and adds functionality
    - jQuery is a JS library
    - A Library is a set of useful functions already created for us

### Elements of a Web App
- Difference between a web app (Facebook) and web page (LighthouseLabs)
- 3 Main components of a Web App
  - Front-End
  - Back-End
  - Database
  - Draw the three part diagram (client, server, cylinder db)


### Front End
- A front end developer translates design into code - they use well designed layouts from designers
- They stand between the designer and the back end developer take the data from the back end developer
- Front end languages live in the browser (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
- Each play a separate role in building the front end of a web application. (How itâ€™s structured, how it looks and how it functions).
